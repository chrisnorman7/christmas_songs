## Once In Royal David's City

### Choir of Kingâ€™s College, Cambridge, Stephen Cleobury

```lyrics
G    D  G     A7     D  G
Once in royal Davids city,
G     Bm   Em    C   D  G
Stood a... lowly cattle shed,
G     D G      A7       D G
Where a mother laid her Baby,
G  Bm   Em     C   D   G
In a... manger for His bed:
C    G        Am     G
Mary was that mother mild,
C     G           C  D   G
Jesus Christ, her little Child.
To the place where He is gone.

## Ding Dong Merrily On High

### Love to Sing

```lyrics
A         D          E
Ding dong merrily on high,
   D          E         A
In heav'n the bells are ringing:
           D          E
Ding dong! verily the sky
   D          E     A
Is riv'n with angel singing
A F#m Bm E F#m A E C#7 F#m D E C#m
Gloria
  D     E    A
Hosanna in excelsis!
```
