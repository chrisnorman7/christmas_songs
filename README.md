## Jingle Bells

### Love to Sing

```lyrics
G
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way.

C
Oh what fun it is to ride

In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!

G
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way.

C              D
Oh what fun it is to ride,

                    G
In a one-horse open sleigh.

G
Dashing through the snow

                    C
In a one-horse open sleigh,

                   D
O'er the fields we go,

                 G
Laughing all the way.

Bells on bob-tails ring,

               C
Making spirits bright.

                  D
What fun it is to ride and sing

                   G
A sleighing song tonight, oh!
```
